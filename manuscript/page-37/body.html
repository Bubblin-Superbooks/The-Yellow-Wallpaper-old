        <p>John is so pleased to see me improve! He laughed a little the other day, and said I seemed to be flourishing in spite of my wall-paper.</p>
        <p>I turned it off with a laugh. I had no intention of telling him it was BECAUSE of the wall-paperâ€”he would make fun of me. He might even want to take me away.</p>
        <p>I don't want to leave now until I have found it out. There is a week more, and I think that will be enough.</p>
        <p>I'm feeling ever so much better! I don't sleep much at night, for it is so interesting to watch developments; but I sleep a good deal in the daytime.</p>
        <p>In the daytime it is tiresome and perplexing.</p>
