        <p>I wonder if they all come out of that wall-paper as I did?</p>
        <p>But I am securely fastened now by my well-hidden ropeâ€”you don't get ME out in the road there!</p>
        <p>I suppose I shall have to get back behind the pattern when it comes night, and that is hard!</p>
        <p>It is so pleasant to be out in this great room and creep around as I please!</p>
        <p>I don't want to go outside. I won't, even if Jennie asks me to.</p>
        <p>For outside you have to creep on the ground, and everything is green instead of yellow.</p>
        <p>But here I can creep smoothly on the floor, and my shoulder just fits in that long smooch around the wall, so I cannot lose my way.</p>
        <p>Why there's John at the door!</p>
