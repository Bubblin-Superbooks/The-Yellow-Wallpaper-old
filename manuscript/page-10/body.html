        <p>Personally, I believe that congenial work, with excitement and change, would do me good.</p>
        <p>But what is one to do?</p>
        <p>I did write for a while in spite of them; but it DOES exhaust me a good deal—having to be so sly about it, or else meet with heavy opposition.</p>
        <p>I sometimes fancy that in my condition if I had less opposition and more society and stimulus—but John says the very worst thing I can do is to think about my condition, and I confess it always makes me feel bad.</p>
        <p>So I will let it alone and talk about the house.</p>
        <p>The most beautiful place! It is quite alone, standing well back from the road, quite three miles from the village. It makes me think of English places that you read about, for there are hedges and walls and gates that lock, and lots of separate little houses for the gardeners and people.</p>
