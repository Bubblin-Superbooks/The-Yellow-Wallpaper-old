        <p>But John says if I feel so, I shall neglect proper self-control; so I take pains to control myselfâ€”before him, at least, and that makes me very tired.</p>
        <p>I don't like our room a bit. I wanted one downstairs that opened on the piazza and had roses all over the window, and such pretty old-fashioned chintz hangings! but John would not hear of it.</p>
        <p>He said there was only one window and not room for two beds, and no near room for him if he took another.</p>
        <p>He is very careful and loving, and hardly lets me stir without special direction.</p>
        <p>I have a schedule prescription for each hour in the day; he takes all care from me, and so I feel basely ungrateful not to value it more.</p>
        <p>He said we came here solely on my account, that I was to have perfect rest and all the air I could get.</p>
