        <p>I am sitting by the window now, up in this atrocious nursery, and there is nothing to hinder my writing as much as I please, save lack of strength.</p>
        <p>John is away all day, and even some nights when his cases are serious.</p>
        <p>I am glad my case is not serious!</p>
        <p>But these nervous troubles are dreadfully depressing.</p>
        <p>John does not know how much I really suffer. He knows there is no REASON to suffer, and that satisfies him.</p>
        <p>Of course it is only nervousness. It does weigh on me so not to do my duty in any way!</p>
        <p>I meant to be such a help to John, such a real rest and comfort, and here I am a comparative burden already!</p>
