        <p>There is a very funny mark on this wall, low down, near the mopboard. A streak that runs round the room. It goes behind every piece of furniture, except the bed, a long, straight, even SMOOCH, as if it had been rubbed over and over.</p>
        <p>I wonder how it was done and who did it, and what they did it for. Round and round and round—round and round and round—it makes me dizzy!</p>
        <p>I really have discovered something at last.</p>
        <p>Through watching so much at night, when it changes so, I have finally found out.</p>
        <p>The front pattern DOES move—and no wonder! The woman behind shakes it!</p>
        <p>Sometimes I think there are a great many women behind, and sometimes only one, and she crawls around fast, and her crawling shakes it all over.</p>
