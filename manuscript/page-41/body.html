        <p>There are always new shoots on the fungus, and new shades of yellow all over it. I cannot keep count of them, though I have tried conscientiously.</p>
        <p>It is the strangest yellow, that wall-paper! It makes me think of all the yellow things I ever saw—not beautiful ones like buttercups, but old foul, bad yellow things.</p>
        <p>But there is something else about that paper—the smell! I noticed it the moment we came into the room, but with so much air and sun it was not bad. Now we have had a week of fog and rain, and whether the windows are open or not, the smell is here.</p>
        <p>It creeps all over the house.</p>
        <p>I find it hovering in the dining-room, skulking in the parlor, hiding in the hall, lying in wait for me on the stairs.</p>
