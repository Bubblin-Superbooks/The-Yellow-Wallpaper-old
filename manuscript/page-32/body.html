        <p>Behind that outside pattern the dim shapes get clearer every day.</p>
        <p>It is always the same shape, only very numerous.</p>
        <p>And it is like a woman stooping down and creeping about behind that pattern. I don't like it a bit. I wonder—I begin to think—I wish John would take me away from here!</p>
        <p>It is so hard to talk with John about my case, because he is so wise, and because he loves me so.</p>
        <p>But I tried it last night.</p>
        <p>It was moonlight. The moon shines in all around just as the sun does.</p>
        <p>I hate to see it sometimes, it creeps so slowly, and always comes in by one window or another.</p>
        <p>John was asleep and I hated to waken him, so I kept still and watched the moonlight on that undulating wall-paper till I felt creepy.</p>
