        <p>It is very seldom that mere ordinary people like John and myself secure ancestral halls for the summer.</p>
        <p>A colonial mansion, a hereditary estate, I would say a haunted house, and reach the height of romantic felicity—but that would be asking too much of fate!</p>
        <p>Still I will proudly declare that there is something queer about it.</p>
        <p>Else, why should it be let so cheaply? And why have stood so long untenanted?</p>
        <p>John laughs at me, of course, but one expects that in marriage.</p>
        <p>John is practical in the extreme. He has no patience with faith, an intense horror of superstition, and he scoffs openly at any talk of things not to be felt and seen and put down in figures.</p>
