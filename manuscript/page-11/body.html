        <p>There is a DELICIOUS garden! I never saw such a garden—large and shady, full of box-bordered paths, and lined with long grape-covered arbors with seats under them.</p>
        <p>There were greenhouses, too, but they are all broken now.</p>
        <p>There was some legal trouble, I believe, something about the heirs and coheirs; anyhow, the place has been empty for years.</p>
        <p>That spoils my ghostliness, I am afraid, but I don't care—there is something strange about the house—I can feel it.</p>
        <p>I even said so to John one moonlight evening, but he said what I felt was a DRAUGHT, and shut the window.</p>
        <p>I get unreasonably angry with John sometimes. I'm sure I never used to be so sensitive. I think it is due to this nervous condition.</p>
