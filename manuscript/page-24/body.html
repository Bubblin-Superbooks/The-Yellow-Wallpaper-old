        <p>But I don't mind it a bitâ€”only the paper.</p>
        <p>There comes John's sister. Such a dear girl as she is, and so careful of me! I must not let her find me writing.</p>
        <p>She is a perfect and enthusiastic housekeeper, and hopes for no better profession. I verily believe she thinks it is the writing which made me sick!</p>
        <p>But I can write when she is out, and see her a long way off from these windows.</p>
        <p>There is one that commands the road, a lovely shaded winding road, and one that just looks off over the country. A lovely country, too, full of great elms and velvet meadows.</p>
        <p>This wall-paper has a kind of sub-pattern in a different shade, a particularly irritating one, for you can only see it in certain lights, and not clearly then.</p>
