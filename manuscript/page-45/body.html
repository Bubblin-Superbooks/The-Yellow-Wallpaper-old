        <p>I can see her out of every one of my windows!</p>
        <p>It is the same woman, I know, for she is always creeping, and most women do not creep by daylight.</p>
        <p>I see her on that long road under the trees, creeping along, and when a carriage comes she hides under the blackberry vines.</p>
        <p>I don't blame her a bit. It must be very humiliating to be caught creeping by daylight!</p>
        <p>I always lock the door when I creep by daylight. I can't do it at night, for I know John would suspect something at once.</p>
        <p>And John is so queer now, that I don't want to irritate him. I wish he would take another room! Besides, I don't want anybody to get that woman out at night but myself.</p>
