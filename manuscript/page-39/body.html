        <p>It gets into my hair.</p>
        <p>Even when I go to ride, if I turn my head suddenly and surprise it—there is that smell!</p>
        <p>Such a peculiar odor, too! I have spent hours in trying to analyze it, to find what it smelled like.</p>
        <p>It is not bad—at first, and very gentle, but quite the subtlest, most enduring odor I ever met.</p>
        <p>In this damp weather it is awful, I wake up in the night and find it hanging over me.</p>
        <p>It used to disturb me at first. I thought seriously of burning the house—to reach the smell.</p>
        <p>But now I am used to it. The only thing I can think of that it is like is the COLOR of the paper! A yellow smell.</p>
