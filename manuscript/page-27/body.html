        <p>I'm getting really fond of the room in spite of the wall-paper. Perhaps BECAUSE of the wall-paper.</p>
        <p>It dwells in my mind so!</p>
        <p>I lie here on this great immovable bed—it is nailed down, I believe—and follow that pattern about by the hour. It is as good as gymnastics, I assure you. I start, we'll say, at the bottom, down in the corner over there where it has not been touched, and I determine for the thousandth time that I WILL follow that pointless pattern to some sort of a conclusion.</p>
        <p>I know a little of the principle of design, and I know this thing was not arranged on any laws of radiation, or alternation, or repetition, or symmetry, or anything else that I ever heard of.</p>
        <p>It is repeated, of course, by the breadths, but not otherwise.</p>
