        <p>Dear John! He loves me very dearly, and hates to have me sick. I tried to have a real earnest reasonable talk with him the other day, and tell him how I wish he would let me go and make a visit to Cousin Henry and Julia.</p>
        <p>But he said I wasn't able to go, nor able to stand it after I got there; and I did not make out a very good case for myself, for I was crying before I had finished.</p>
        <p>It is getting to be a great effort for me to think straight. Just this nervous weakness I suppose.</p>
        <p>And dear John gathered me up in his arms, and just carried me upstairs and laid me on the bed, and sat by me and read to me till it tired my head.</p>
        <p>He said I was his darling and his comfort and all he had, and that I must take care of myself for his sake, and keep well.</p>
