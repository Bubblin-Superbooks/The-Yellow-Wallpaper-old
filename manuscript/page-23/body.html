        <p>But I don't want to go there at all. I had a friend who was in his hands once, and she says he is just like John and my brother, only more so!</p>
        <p>Besides, it is such an undertaking to go so far.</p>
        <p>I don't feel as if it was worth while to turn my hand over for anything, and I'm getting dreadfully fretful and querulous.</p>
        <p>I cry at nothing, and cry most of the time.</p>
        <p>Of course I don't when John is here, or anybody else, but when I am alone.</p>
        <p>And I am alone a good deal just now. John is kept in town very often by serious cases, and Jennie is good and lets me alone when I want her to.</p>
        <p>So I walk a little in the garden or down that lovely lane, sit on the porch under the roses, and lie down up here a good deal.</p>
