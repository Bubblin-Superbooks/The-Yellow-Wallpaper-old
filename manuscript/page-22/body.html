        <p>I wish I could get well faster.</p>
        <p>But I must not think about that. This paper looks to me as if it KNEW what a vicious influence it had!</p>
        <p>There is a recurrent spot where the pattern lolls like a broken neck and two bulbous eyes stare at you upside down.</p>
        <p>I get positively angry with the impertinence of it and the everlastingness. Up and down and sideways they crawl, and those absurd, unblinking eyes are everywhere. There is one place where two breadths didn't match, and the eyes go all up and down the line, one a little higher than the other.</p>
        <p>I never saw so much expression in an inanimate thing before, and we all know how much expression they have! I used to lie awake as a child and get more entertainment and terror out of blank walls and plain furniture than most children could find in a toy store.</p>
